## Current Features (Version  1.8 – May 19, 2016)

- Create unlimited custom user groups
- Add members to each group
- Select which parts of Spiceworks each group is allowed access to
- If a user clicks a link to a restricted section, they will be denied access
- If a user manually types in a URL for a restricted section, they will be denied access
- Full access is granted to sections not listed in the Permissions list (ie. other installed apps, etc.)
- Assign an “Admin Override Passcode” that allows you to bypass access denied messages to access any part of Spiceworks (default passcode = “override”)
